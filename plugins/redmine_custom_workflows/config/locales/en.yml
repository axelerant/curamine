  text_custom_workflow_before_save_note: You can change properties of the issues here. Do not create or update related issues in this script. To finish with error, use raise WorkflowError, "Message to user".
  text_custom_workflow_after_save_note: You can update or create related issues here. Note that this script will be also executed for the newly created issues. So make appropriate checks to prevent infinite recursion.
  text_custom_workflow_general_note: Both scripts are executed in the context of the issue like ordinary before_save and after_save callbacks. So use methods and properties of the issue directly (or through "self"). Instance variables (@variable) are also allowed and may be used if needed.
  text_no_enabled_projects: No projects
